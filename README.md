We were given these parts:
1. Adafruit Fona Feather micro controller board
2. Adafruit 16 NeoPixel Ring
3. Quad-Band Antenna
4. Stacking Headers
5. Lithium Ion Battery 3.7v
6. Twilio Programmable SIM card

[And Margaret's instructions.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ngfbno9w8qv5zt/Holiday%20Hardware%20Hack.pdf?dl=0)
See pages 27 - 42 for instructions to set up the Twilio phone number for sending text messages to your ornament.

My sister-in-law gave me some facial mudd for Christmas and the container was the perfect size and shape for containing the electronics! I put the mudd in something else, drilled and cut some holes in the container for the USB connection, NeoPixel wiring, on/off switch and ribbon.

I used FILO clay to create the wreath and ribbon embellishments.

I had a lot of fun with this! I learned that I really enjoyed soldering, creating, and programming electronics!

Possible TODO's: Add speaker to play christmas music radio station, Fona sleep/off ...
